# 📚 EduVision – Learning Dashboard

EduVision is a small project I built to practice and showcase front-end development and working with LocalStorage.  
I wanted something more interesting then my last project which was (task tracker),so I made a learning dashboard where you can create courses, add lessons, and track your progress.

Everything runs in the browser — no backend, no frameworks.

What You Can Do
- Create your own courses  
- Add lessons inside each course  
- Check lessons off when you complete them  
- See total courses, lessons, and completed lessons  
- All data stays saved using LocalStorage  

I kept the UI clean and simple so it feels like a real dashboard.

 Tech Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript 
LocalStorage

No libraries or external tools. I wanted to practice building everything by hand.

I already made a task tracker, so I wanted another small project that still shows my ability to structure an app, work with data, and build a nice UI.
